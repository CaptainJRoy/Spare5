Spare 5 Script i've been working on

So this is a script i made for the website Spare5. It automaticcaly select and complete available tasks (not every one). Note that i decided to make this script public, now that i don't use the website anymore. As a result of this, it might become redundant, however you may use the code as you wish. I only ask you to mention me if you give it to someone.
I believe that now the use of scripts is prohibited, so do it at your own risk.
